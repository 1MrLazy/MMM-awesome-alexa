# MMM-awesome-alexa
> A hands free Alexa module for the Magic Mirror, which is activated when you say 'Alexa'.

## Installation

1\. Execute the following commands to install the module:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules # navigate to module folder
git clone https://github.com/dolanmiu/MMM-awesome-alexa.git # clone this repository
```

2\. Go to https://magic-mirror-avs.github.io/Alexa-Web-Helper/ and generate a config for this alexa module. I have tried to make this step as simple as possible.

3\. Then, add the previously generated config from the website above and put it into the `modules` section of your `config/config.js` file.

**Note:** For an easy set up, you can omit step 2, and 3, and this will instead use alexa credentials I created, so that even novices can get started. But it is highly recommended you use your own!
