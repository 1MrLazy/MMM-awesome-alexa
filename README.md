# MMM-awesome-alexa
> A hands free Alexa module for the Magic Mirror, which is activated when you say 'Alexa'.

## Installation

1\. Execute the following commands to install the module:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules # navigate to module folder
git clone https://github.com/dolanmiu/MMM-awesome-alexa.git # clone this repository
```

2\. Go to [LINK HERE] and generate a config for your alexa module. If you want an extremely easy set up, you can **omit** this step, and set 3 completely!

3\. Then, add the previously generated config from the website above and put it into the `modules` section of your `config/config.js` file.

**Note:** For an easy set up, you can omit step 2, and 3, and this will instead use alexa credentials I created, so that even novices can get started. But it is highly recommended you use your own!
